<h1 align="center">Red Python Scripts</h1>

#Warning
Use of these scripts can compromise most(if not all) computer systems. Proceed with caution. **I am not liable for damaged caused** due to their execution on any system or individual.

##How to Run
- To run Python scripts with the python command, you need to open a command-line and type in the word `python` , or `python3` if you have both versions, followed by the path to your script, just like this: `$ python3 hello.py`
- Alternatively you can use the execfile() command `>>> execfile('hello.py')`

##How to Stop
- To stop a python script just press `Ctrl + C`, Alternatively, `kill -9` it.

# Other Alternatives
- You can also do it if you use the `exit()` function in your code. More ideally, you can do `sys.exit()` which might terminate Python even if you are running things in parallel through the multiprocessing package.

Note: In order to use the `sys.exit()`, you must import it: `import sys`

- You can use `pkill -f name-of-the-python-script`.

**Enjoy using the code** :tada:
